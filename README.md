# Bank-Account-Program--Java--
Modelling a bank account program using the Object-Oriented Programming concepts of Java.

This is a console based program where the user can create a bank account (chequing or savings account), deposit and withdraw money and view individual account information. The program can save data to a file so that all the accounts created and the transactions done will get saved even if the user exits the program. Upon running the program again the user can view all the bank accounts created and transcations done from the previous instance of running the program. 

There are also some administrative features in the program where the administrator can view all the bank accounts information stored in the program at once and can also remove all the bank account records from the program. Accessing the administrator features requires a password and the password is "2022".

The program should be runned using the BankRunner.java file stored in the src folder.
